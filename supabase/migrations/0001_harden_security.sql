-- Locks down role assignment and table access.
--
-- Before this migration the browser inserted its own role row, so anyone could
-- make themselves an admin from the console, and every table was readable and
-- writable with the public anon key. Run this once against your project:
--
--   Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor -> paste -> Run
--   (or: supabase db push)
--
-- It is idempotent: re-running it is safe.

-- The old client-side signup inserted a row on every sign-up with no conflict
-- handling and no unique constraint, so duplicate emails are likely. Collapse
-- them before adding the index, keeping the most privileged row per address
-- (an existing admin must not be demoted by this cleanup).
